Hi, guys! This works for me (on simulator):

Xcode menu -> Product -> Edit Scheme...
Environment Variables -> Add -> Name: "OS_ACTIVITY_MODE", Value:"disable"
Run your app again, done!

- remove and add plugin:
cdv plugin rm cordova-plugin-mediabeef-background-geolocation && cdv plugin add /var/www/mwcog-phonegap-background-geo

2 Currently at the end of the trip you are triggering a popup message inside the app saying "trip completed" -- can you copy that message to be a notification instead so that the user will see it even if their screen is locked?
3 When you click that notification and/or resume the app:
 a/you are currently showing the "Trip completed" popup (that's okay - keep this)
 b/when the user clicks the close button on the popup they are still on the "start flextime trip" page -- can you send them back to the logged-in dashboard instead?


- to fix timeutils:
put this inside build.gradle ext:
    postBuildExtras = {
        android {
            lintOptions {
                disable 'RestrictedApi'
            }
        }
    }
